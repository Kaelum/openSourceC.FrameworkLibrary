	/// <summary>
	///		Provides a base implementation for the extensible provider model.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///		The provider model is intended to encapsulate all or part of the functionality of
	///		multiple application features, such as persistence, profiles, and protected
	///		configuration. It allows the developer to create supporting classes that provide
	///		multiple implementations of the encapsulated functionality. In addition, developers can
	///		write new features using the provider model. This can be an effective way to support
	///		multiple implementations of a feature's functionality without duplicating the feature
	///		code or recoding the application layer if the implementation method needs to be changed.
	///		<para>The RemotingProviderBase class is simple, containing only a few basic methods and
	///		properties that are common to all providers. Feature-specific providers inherit from
	///		RemotingProviderBase and establish the necessary methods and properties that the
	///		implementation-specific providers for that feature must support. Implementation-specific
	///		providers inherit in turn from a feature-specific provider.</para>
	///		<para>The most important aspect of the provider model is that the implementation (for
	///		example, whether data is persisted as a text file or in a database) is abstracted from
	///		the application code. The type of the implementation-specific provider for the given
	///		feature is designated in a configuration file. The feature-level provider then reads in
	///		the type from the configuration file and acts as a factory to the feature code. The
	///		application developer can then use the feature classes in the application code. The
	///		implementation type can be swapped out in the configuration file, eliminating the need
	///		to rewrite the code to accommodate the different implementation methodology.</para>
	///		<para>This model can, and should, be applied to any kind of feature functionality that
	///		could be abstracted and implemented in multiple ways.</para>
	/// </remarks>
