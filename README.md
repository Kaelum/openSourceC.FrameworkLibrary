# openSourceC.FrameworkLibrary

### Pre-release
Before I create the first release package, I need to work on the WCF client/server functionality to tie tiers together.  The library is functional as-is, and I do use it in every project that I work on, but it's not in a release ready state as I do refactor entire sections from time to time.  You are free to use it as-is, just be aware that the release version will most likely be quite different from the current version, once I finally do release it.

#### Project Description
A C# framework library that I have been working on for the past 13 years, as an alternative to Microsoft's Enterprise Library. The library had its beginnings based on C/C++ and VB6 code and has been modified over the years to its current C# form.

I created this site back in 2006 when I was primarily working with Community Server on the side.  I currently no longer support Community Server, but I do have some open source projects that I have been meaning to make available.  Here is a list of some of the projects that I have been working on:  
  
* ~~**[openSourceC.Daylife](http://oscdaylife.codeplex.com/)**~~
  * ~~A client API library that allows full .NET access to the entire [Daylife API](http://developer.daylife.com/).~~
* ~~**[openSourceC.Factiva](http://oscfactiva.codeplex.com/)**~~
  * ~~A client API library that allows full .NET access to the Factiva Select service.~~
* **[openSourceC.FrameworkLibrary](https://www.github.com/Kaelum/openSourceC.FrameworkLibrary/)**
  * A C#.NET 4.0 Framework Library that I have been working on for the past 9 years.
  * The library has evolved over time, starting out as miscellaneous C/C++ and VB6 code snippets from the mid to late 90's.
* ~~**[openSourceC.NewsCred](http://oscnewscred.codeplex.com/)**~~
  * ~~A client API library that allows full .NET access to the NewsCred API.~~
